# Computer Graphics

Computer graphics class projects.

## Render

The render can generate a PPM image from a scene description file (example of the file: https://gist.github.com/raquel-oliveira/94cd1bf00dc744cab1c0be9f0076702b).

Note that in this description file the colors of the 4 corner points are defined. The colors of the rest of the image are generated by a bi linear interpolation.

A  4 spheres are created by default over the background with following characteristics:
  Sphere((Point3(0,-100.5,-3)), 99.f)
  Sphere((Point3(0.3,0,-1)), 0.4)
  Sphere((Point3(0,1,-2)), 0.6)
  Sphere((Point3(-0.4,0,-3)), 0.7)

Their color are formed by the mapping from normals to RGB.
