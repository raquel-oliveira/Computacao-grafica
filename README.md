# Computer Graphics

Computer graphics class projects.

## Render

The render can generate a PPM image from a scene description file (example of the file: https://gist.github.com/raquel-oliveira/94cd1bf00dc744cab1c0be9f0076702b).

Note that in this description file the colors of the 4 corner points are defined. The colors of the rest of the image are generated by a bi linear interpolation.

A sphere is created by default over the background with radius = 0.5, origin point: (0,0,-1) an the color is formed by a normal surface.
