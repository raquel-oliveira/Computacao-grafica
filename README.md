# Computer Graphics

Computer graphics class projects.

## First Assignment

In this version, the render can generate a PPM image from a scene description file (example of the file: https://gist.github.com/raquel-oliveira/94cd1bf00dc744cab1c0be9f0076702b).

Note that in this description file the colors of the 4 corner points are defined. The colors of the rest of the image are generated by a bi linear interpolation.

To run this version of render:

Run `make`

Run `cd build`

Run `./render description_file.txt`
